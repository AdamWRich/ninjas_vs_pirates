# ninjas_vs_pirates

Hello World!

This is a fun little game that I created based on a project from my Coding Dojo course on python. The overall goal was to learn how to use methods and attributes in module classes to create a game with some functionality. 
I will be updating slowly to clean up the code (specifically in the attack sequence function in game.py).

Download and play in your terminal!

PS. as of right now, I believe only selecting 'Ninja' as your character will work.
